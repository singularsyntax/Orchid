## New Features

- Adds API for managing deployments within Orchid. API is set up and tested, but there are no Publisher implementations
    yet. See docs for {{anchor('OrchidPublisher')}} for building custom publishers, and 
    {{anchor('Deployment Pipelines')}} for how to implement and use a deployment pipeline. 

## Bugfixes

- Fixes issue where an empty `config.yml` caused a crash. ([#123](https://github.com/JavaEden/Orchid/issues/123))
- Prevents Pebble from stripping whitespace. While this may increase the resulting size of your site, it prevents some
    issues it was causing when using Pebble for pre-compiling Markdown and other content that is sensitive to whitespace.
