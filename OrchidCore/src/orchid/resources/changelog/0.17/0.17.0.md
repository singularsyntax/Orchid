## Improvements and Bugfixes

- **Netlify Publisher**
    - Now handles uploads of really large sites. Previously, deploys of more than a couple thousand pages or so would 
        time out and fail.
    - It can infer the Netlify siteId from the Orchid base URL, and is now an optional property
- **Wikis**
    - PDF ebooks generated by Wiki plugin are now included in a Collection, so they can be linked to with the linking 
        functions and in menus
    - Fixed bug creating PDF ebooks for multiple sections
- **Changelogs**
    - Adds Archetype to Changelog entries from `changelog.allVersions` in `config.yml`
    - Version bumps are inferred from changelog entries, and no longer need to be manually entered
    - Improves formatting of `meta/versions.json` file. Release notes can now be embedded in this JSON file
- **Other**
    - Improves console output of Git-based publishers and Swiftdoc plugin
    - Swiftdoc plugin now accepts a list of source roots to find Swift sources, rather than a single directory
    - `.puml` file extension is now recognized as a PlantUML file by default
    - Fixed NPE calling a TemplateFunction as a Clog-formatted string
    - Fixes formatting of dates in sitemap XML files so as to not cause warnings from Google indices

## 0.16.x to 0.17.0 Migration Guide 

- The key for the Github Pages publisher has renamed. Change `ghPages` to `githubPages` in your `config.yml` publication
    pipeline
- The `baseDir` property in Swiftdoc plugin configuration has been changed to `sourceDirs` to match other code-doc 
    plugins, and now accepts either a single String or a list of Strings as a value.
- The Github Pages publisher has been moved out of `OrchidCore` and into the {{ anchor('OrchidGithub') }} integration
    project. Likewise, the Github Releases publisher has been moved from `OrchidChangelog` to `OrchidGithub`, and the 
    `githubProject()` global collection has been moved from `OrchidCopper` to `OrchidGithub`. Add the
    `io.github.javaeden.orchid:OrchidGithub:{{site.version}}` dependency to continue using these features
- The Netlify publisher has been moved out of `OrchidCore` and into the {{ anchor('OrchidNetlify') }} integration
    project. Add the `io.github.javaeden.orchid:OrchidNetlify:{{site.version}}` dependency to continue using the Netlify 
    publisher
- The following "spells" supported by Clog have been removed: [ `baseUrl`, `baseUrlScheme`, `baseUrlHost`, 
    `baseUrlPort`, `baseUrlRoot`, `version`, `orchidVersion`, `env` ] . Instead, use the normal TemplateFunctions within 
    Clog-formatted strings for `baseUrl`, and create TemplateFunctions for your site as a local plugin if your need the
    other Clog spells
- The `changelogVersionPicker` component has been removed, as it has not worked for quite a while. You should create 
    this component yourself using Javascript to match your theme
- **Notable dependency changes**
    - Flexmark `Extensions` have changed packages. Custom Flexmark extensions now must be of the type 
    `com.vladsch.flexmark.util.builder.Extension`
